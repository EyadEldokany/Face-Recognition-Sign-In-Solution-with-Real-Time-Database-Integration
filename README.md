Face Recognition Sign-In System
A secure and seamless authentication system that uses facial recognition for user sign-in. This project leverages AI-powered face detection and integrates with a database to manage user authentication, offering customizable UI/UX and robust security features.

Features
Face Recognition Authentication: Uses advanced machine learning algorithms for face detection and matching.
Database Integration: Stores user data and facial recognition encodings in a MySQL/PostgreSQL database.
Customizable UI/UX: Tailor the interface to match your branding (logos, colors, etc.).
Multi-Factor Authentication: Adds an extra layer of security with additional authentication methods.
Encryption & Secure Communication: Protects user data with encryption and secure transmission protocols (HTTPS).
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Supports Windows, macOS, and Linux.
